                Your people suffer for a few generations<br \>
                As time goes on, newer generations are able to build stronger immune systems to adapt to this primitive world<br \>
                Fast forward 1000 years<br \>
                Since there was no information passed on about technology, your world is still in the primitive era<br \>               
                The future of your world is unpredictable <br \>
