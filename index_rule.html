                Not wanting to repeat the same mistakes of the old world, you make laws accordingly<br \>
                The crown is passed down through generations after you pass away<br \>
                Since the world is under dictatorship, the laws change almost every few decades depending on the ruler<br \>
                Fast forward 1000 years<br \>
                With High end technology and dictatorship your world is not in good hands<br \>
